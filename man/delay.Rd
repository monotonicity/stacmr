\description{
Data from 130 \code{participant}s with two between-participants factors (\code{delay}
and \code{structure}) with two levels each and one within-participants factor
(\code{block}) with four levels. The dependent variable is proportion correct
\code{pc}.
}
\details{
Participants in this study completed one of two category-learning tasks
defined according to the category \code{structure} that participants learned. For
the rule-based (RB) group, the category structure was defined by a simple
rule. For the information-integration (II) group, the category structure was
more complex and could not be defined by a simple rule.

The experiment consisted of four 80-trial \code{block}s for each participant. Within each block, all 80
stimuli were presented in a random order (with different orders for each
participant). Participants were told to learn which of four categories (labeled,
1, 2, 3, and 4) each stimulus belonged to. On each trial, a stimulus was
presented, and participants terminated the display by pressing one of the
keys labeled 1-4 on the computer keyboard corresponding to Categories 1-4,
respectively. Following the response, a mask appeared. The length with which
the mask was shown defined the \code{delay} condition. Either 0.5-s (No Delay
condition) or 5-s (Delay condition).

Following presentation of the mask, feedback appeared on the computer screen
for 0.75 s. If the response was correct, the word "Correct" was presented;
otherwise, the word "Incorrect" was presented.  Following presentation of
feedback, a blank screen followed the duration of which was again defined the
\code{delay} condition. The screen was blank for either 5 s (No Delay condition)
or 0.5 s (Delay condition) before the next trial commenced. The sequence and
timing of these events were same as those used by Maddox and Ing (2005).

### mr() fits monotonic regression with specified partial order

## for delay data: order of factor-levels corresponds to expected partial order.
## Therefore, 'partial = "auto"' can be used to enforce this order.
mr_d1 <- mr(
  data = delay, 
  col_value = "pc", 
  col_participant = "participant",
  col_dv = "structure", 
  col_within = "block", 
  col_between = "delay", 
  nsample = 1e4, 
  partial = "auto"
)
mr_d1

## Alternatively, partial order can be specified symbolically:
mr_d2 <- mr(
  data = delay, 
  col_value = "pc", 
  col_participant = "participant",
  col_dv = "structure", 
  col_within = "block", 
  col_between = "delay", 
  nsample = 1e4, 
  partial = list(
    delay = "delay < `no delay`",
    block = "B1 < B2 < B3 < B4"
  )
)
mr_d2

## Partial order can also be specified partially symbolically:
mr_d3 <- mr(
  data = delay, 
  col_value = "pc", 
  col_participant = "participant",
  col_dv = "structure", 
  col_within = "block", 
  col_between = "delay", 
  nsample = 1e4, 
  partial = list(
    delay = "auto",
    block = "B1 < B2 < B3 < B4"
  )
)
mr_d3
all.equal(mr_d3$partial, mr_d1$partial)

st_d4 <- cmr(
  data = delay, 
  col_value = "pc", 
  col_participant = "participant",
  col_dv = "structure", 
  col_within = "block", 
  col_between = "delay", 
  nsample = 1e4, 
  partial = "auto"
)

mr_d5 <- mr(
  data = delay, 
  col_value = "pc", 
  col_participant = "participant",
  col_dv = "structure",

  nsample = 1e4,

    block = "B1 < B2 < B3 < B4"
  )

  col_dv = "structure", 
  col_within = "block",

  nsample = 1e4, 
  partial = list(
    delay = "delay = `no delay`",
    block = "B1 < B2 < B3 < B4"

  col_within = "block", 
  col_between = "delay", 
  nsample = 1e4, 
  partial = list(
    delay = "`no delay` < delay",
    block = "B1 < B2 < B3 < B4"
  )
)

### OLD STUFF BELOW: CHANGE PLEASE

#### Fit and specify partial order that should be obeyed by data
# Create Partial Order
E <- list(c(1:4),c(5:8),c(5,1),c(6,2),c(7,3),c(8,4))
list2adj(1:8, E)

### Fits Partial Order Model to Data
fit2 <- fit_mr(data=delay, col_value = "pc", 
               col_participant = "participant",
               col_dv = "structure", 
               col_within = "block", 
               col_between = "delay",
               partial=E)
cbind(fit2$x[[1]],fit2$x[[2]]) # simplify presentation
fit2$fval
fit2$shrinkage

### Test fit of Partial Order Model
test2 <- test_mr(data=delay, col_value = "pc", 
                 col_participant = "participant",
                 col_dv = "structure", 
                 col_within = "block", 
                 col_between = "delay", 
                 partial=E, nsample=10000)
test2$p
test2$datafit

#### test conjoint model versus partial order model
### p-Value of Difference in Fit of Conjoint Monotonic and Fit of Partial Order Model
