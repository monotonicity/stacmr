# stacmr

<!-- badges: start -->
  [![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/monotonicity/stacmr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/monotonicity/stacmr)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `stacmr` is to provide functionality for state-trace analysis via conjoint monotonic regression. The main function for this is `cmr()`. In addition, it provides functionality for fitting monotonic regression models with function `mr()`.

## Installation

You can install the released version of stacmr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
## NOT YET AVAILABLE FROM CRAN
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("monotonicity/stacmr")
```
## Example

This is a basic example.

```{r example}
library(stacmr)
## load data from Exp. 1 of Dunn, Newell, & Kalish (2012)
data(delay)
str(delay, width = 78, strict.width = "cut")

stats <- sta_stats(
  data = delay, 
  col_value = "pc", 
  col_participant = "participant",
  col_dv = "structure", 
  col_within = "block", 
  col_between = "delay"
)
stats


### cmr() fits conjoint monotonic regression for state-trace analysis
## Fit and test CMR State-Trace Analysis Model
st_d1 <- cmr(
  data = delay, 
  col_value = "pc", 
  col_participant = "participant",
  col_dv = "structure", 
  col_within = "block", 
  col_between = "delay", 
  nsample = 1e4
)
st_d1  ## basic information about conjoint-monotonic model

summary(st_d1)  ## basic information plus estimated cell means

### cmr() also accepts partial order. 
## CMR model is tested against MR model with partial order 
st_d3 <- cmr(
  data = delay, 
  col_value = "pc", 
  col_participant = "participant",
  col_dv = "structure", 
  col_within = "block", 
  col_between = "delay", 
  partial = "auto"
)
st_d3
summary(st_d3)
```
