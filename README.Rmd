The goal of stacmr is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of stacmr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
## NOT YET AVAILABLE FROM CRAN
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("monotonicity/stacmr")
```
## Example

This is a basic example.

```{r example}
library(stacmr)
## load data from Exp. 1 of Dunn, Newell, & Kalish (2012)
data(delay)
str(delay, width = 78, strict.width = "cut")

stats <- sta_stats(data=delay, col_value = "pc", 
          col_participant = "participant",
          col_dv = "structure", 
          col_within = "block", 
          col_between = "delay")
stats
str(stats)


### Fit CMR State-Trace Analysis Model
fit1 <- fit_cmr(data=delay, col_value = "pc", 
                col_participant = "participant",
                col_dv = "structure", 
                col_within = "block", 
                col_between = "delay")
cbind(fit1$x[[1]], fit1$x[[2]])
fit1$fval
fit1$shrinkage


### Test CMR State-Trace Analysis
test1 <- test_cmr(data=delay, col_value = "pc", 
                  col_participant = "participant",
                  col_dv = "structure", 
                  col_within = "block", 
                  col_between = "delay")
test1
```
