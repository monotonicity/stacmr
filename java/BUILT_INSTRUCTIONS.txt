Building the .jar files requires software Maven: https://maven.apache.org/
On Linux systems maven can often be installed directly from the terminal, e.g.:
sudo apt-get install maven

With maven installed simply run the following command at the terminal: 
mvn package

Run this command in the current directory (i.e., the same directory as the pom.xml file).
Note that this also requires a Java development environment, e.g.:
sudo apt-get install default-jdk

If successful, this will produce the .jar file in inst/java  
In case of multiple .jar files, use the one with dependencies.
