- Should be a separate package from stacmr but have 4 similar user facing functions (maybe same name) for SDA of individual-level data
- also expose aggregated data functionality to the user (not only individual-level trial) in this case we have 4 additional functions that accept data in slightly different way (maybe simply add an a to beginning function name: scmr, smr, sbcmr, smr). The columns will be:
  - col_value (or col_success and col_failure)
  - col_sd
  - col_n
  - col_condition (which combines between and within conditions again)
  - default should be approx TRUE
- model defines structure of problem as a model matrix.
  - number of rows is number of DVs
  - number of columns is number of latent variables
  - matrix is model matrix of latent model
- values in matrix indicate whether or not a certain latent variable affect a specific DV.
- In STA case, model matrix is simply a matrix with ones (i.e., two rows and one column).
- For reasoning example, 4 DVs are: valid-deductive, valid-inductive, invalid-deductive, invalid-inductive
- Maybe good example: Lassiter & Goodman model
  - For this two by-participant data sets exists: Lassiter & Goodman and Singmann & Klauer (2011)
