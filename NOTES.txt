- between and within argument should accept several column names which are combined as a lexicographic order.
- both col_between and col_within should be optional (i.e., if none, only one level of factor)
- cmr() function should do both fitting and testing with argument test = TRUE as default (if false, only fitting, but no testing).
- It would be great to get from the bootstrap not only function value, but fitted values to get estimate of precision of fitted values (i.e., predicted cell means)
- mr() function should work with one level of DV, and return 0 (with warning) if no partial order is specified. Warning: "No partial order specified. SSE necessarily 0."
- column names for binomial: col_condition (combines between and within as there is only between implemented), col_success and col_failure for both frequencies (need to be integers).
- in binomial case, emit warning if within-column is detected.
- for partial order, could be specified on factor levels and then implied order be computed.
- partial order should accept either:
    - "auto": completely implied by order of factor levels
    - list(delay = "auto")
    - list(delay = "`no delay` = `delay`", block = "auto")
    - list(delay = "auto", block = "B1 < B2 = B3 < B4")
    - symbolic specification only allows less-than (which means less-than or equal) and equality.
- if data is in summary statistics format (need to check how this works with the new format), parametric bootstrap is used in contrast to the non-parametric bootstrap implemented by default ()

## Example Session
obj <- cmr(...)/mr(...)
obj
# p-value
# names of DVs
# number of data points

summary(obj)
# same information as print plus estimated cell means
# fit value
# Sum-of-squared errors (SSE)

state_trace(obj) ## produces state trace plot

plot_null(obj)  ## produces histogram of empirical (boot-strapped) null distribution
